Project Overview

This project is a machine learning model to predict loan approval status based on applicant details. The model is built using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

Files Included

LOAN PREDICTION.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

requirements.txt: List of required Python packages (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn).

README.md: Project documentation (this file).

Prerequisites

Python 3.9 or above

Jupyter Notebook

Install required packages using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset

The dataset contains information about loan applicants including gender, marital status, income, loan amount, credit history, and loan status.

Steps Implemented in the Notebook

Data Loading: Load dataset using Pandas.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze data distribution and identify patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

Model Building: Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression) using scikit-learn.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

Results and Insights: Present key findings and insights from the model's performance.

How to Run the Project

Clone the repository or download the project files.

Install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt.

Open LOAN PREDICTION.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Run all cells to execute the project workflow.

Results

The model achieved an accuracy score of [Add Accuracy]%.

Important features influencing loan approval were [Add Key Features].

Future Improvements

Experiment with different models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).

Perform hyperparameter tuning.

Enhance data preprocessing techniques.
